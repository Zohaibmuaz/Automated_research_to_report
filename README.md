# ü§ñ Autonomous AI Business Intelligence Department

This repository contains the code for a fully autonomous, multi-agent system designed to function as a Business Intelligence (BI) department. This system automates the entire workflow of market research, from initial data gathering and analysis to the final synthesis of a professional, human-readable report.

This project is the capstone of the "Autonomous AI Systems Architect" course, demonstrating advanced concepts in agentic design, system architecture, and production-ready deployment.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Capabilities

This is not just a script; it's a prototype of a fully automated business function designed for real-world application.

* **Autonomous Operation:** The system runs end-to-end without any human intervention. It takes a list of research topics and handles the entire process from data gathering to final report generation.

* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** It uses a sophisticated crew of specialized AI agents (Researcher, Analyst, and Writer/Notifier) that collaborate to solve the problem, with each agent handling a specific part of the workflow.

* **Intelligent & Adaptive:** The system is built on **LangGraph**, allowing for complex, stateful workflows. It can handle real-world failures (like un-scrapable websites), adapt its strategy, and make decisions based on the quality of data at each stage.

* **Structured & Reliable Output:** It leverages **Pydantic** to enforce strict data schemas, ensuring the output from the analysis agent is always clean, predictable, and reliable for use in the final report.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The core problem this system solves is the time-consuming, manual process of market research. The architecture is designed as a **stateful graph** where each node represents a specialized agent, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a robust data pipeline.

**Workflow:**
`Start` -> `[Agent 1: News Researcher]` -> `[Agent 2: Data Analyst]` -> `[Agent 3: Report Writer & Notifier]` -> `End`

1.  **News Researcher:** Scans the web for the latest news on a given topic using the Tavily API, which provides pre-cleaned article content.
2.  **Data Analyst:** Reads the research and synthesizes it into a structured `AnalysisReport` containing key findings, overall sentiment, and potential business impact.
3.  **Report Writer & Notifier:** Takes the structured analysis and delivers the final, formatted report to a specified online source (e.g., via Resend or Discord) for easy access.
